# YouTube to Discord Soundboard File

This application is written using React + Express with Vite.

The backend server is under `server/app.js` and uses the `nodemon` npm package to run it with hot reloading.

To run locally, cd into the folder and run:

```
npm install
nodemon server/app.js
npm run dev
```

This will start up a local dev server.
